\description{
This function modifies pieces of row and column labels
according to \code{label_map} that defines "one or many to one" relationships.
This function is useful for aggregations.
For example, replacing nouns can be done by
\verb{modify_label_pieces(<<labels>>, piece = "noun", label_map = list(new_noun = c("a", "b", "c"))}.
The string "new_noun" will replace any of "a", "b", or "c"
when they appear as nouns in a row or column label.
See examples for details.
